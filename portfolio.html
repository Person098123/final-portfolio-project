        This is where you'll find my resume and what my skill set is and all that. I Have a current GPA of 3.8 with a constant 3.6 or higher GPA ever since middle school. 
        I have taken two AP classes, those being AP Computer Science Principles and AP Environmental Science with me also getting a 3 out of 5 for the AP test for Computer 
        Science Principles. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, Mathematics (at an advanced math level), and a little bit of Java Script. I have gotten honor rolls multiple 
        times within my high school career and have also gotten a principal's honor roll for having a 4.0 GPA.
