    <h1>About Me Page</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Tameem Mahmnoud and I was born on April 14, 2006 to quite a large family. I will be graduating from my home school of Clovis West on June 5, 2024 and I 
        plan to attend college afterwards. My Hobbies include playing video games, playing Badminton, reading, watching movies/tv shows, and every once in a while I like to 
        go go kart racing. I also attend the Esports club at my school which has been really nice and fun, especially when you have some friends with you to enjoy it. I have
        gotten honor rolls multiple times in my high school career as well as gotten a principal's honor roll as well. My GPA has stuck to a consistent 3.6 or higher ever
        since middle school and being able to join two AP classes (AP Computer Science Principles and Ap Environmental Science) with me also getting a 3 on the computer
        science AP test. I have skills in Mathematics( up to advanced math), HTML, CSS, and a little javascript but I hope to hone these skills further for my future.

    <p>My favorite hobby is definitely video games by a long shot and it was my main hobby ever since I was 5. My favorite video games are Portal 2, Legend of Zelda, 
       Tears of the Kingdom, Celeste, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Rhythm Heaven Fever.</p>

    <p>My favorite sport is hands down badminton because it has a fun rhythm of trying to keep up a rally while also trying to find opportunities to score a point.</p>
