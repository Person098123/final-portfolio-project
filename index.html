    <h1>Tameem Mahmoud's Personal Website</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome to anyone who is willing to take time out of your day to look through my personal website. My name is Tameem Masad Mahmoud and this is where 
       you'll find all the information about me, my projects, resume/portfolio and where you can potentially contact me. AlI of these are available on the top menu 
       bar. I have been at CART for only one year but in that year it has helped me reinvigorate my goals and dreams for the future. Web Application has taught
       me a lot and this is the ultimate result of that. Hope you enjoy it.</p>

        <button><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></button>
        <p>This website is mostly made to explore the possibilities of using CSS (cascading style sheets) and how we can design the website to whatever we like. CSS 
           is basically the makeup of a website which helps it give it its feel and style.

        <p>This website was a collaboration with a partner where we were given the assignment of making a branch of a hypothetical part of a Jurassic park website 
           if we were hired to make one.</p>

        <button><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></button>
        <p>The certificate Generator was made for mostly a joke having to make a website that produces a joke certificate of varying options. Despite its description 
           it really helped me understand JS (Java Script)</p>

        <p>This was one of the bigger projects having to make a website that helps you budget your spendings for a month. It was a challenge to say the least but it was 
           a welcoming one.</p>
