    <h1>Projects Page</h1>

    <p>This page is specially made to show off some of my projects that I have had a chance to either complete or it helps hone my skills for coding in 
        general (can be both). My experience with these projects have helped mold my skills for coding and the experience from all of them generally 
        makes me confident in my abilities. But these projects were also done under lots of stress due to the nature of having to complete these on a 
        deadline and also having to learn what you're doing first but you will always find your footing in the end if you keep on pushing on. If you 
        want to try out or see my projects click on the button below the picture</p>
