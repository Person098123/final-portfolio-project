<section class="thanks">
    <p>This page is specially made to lead you to other pages that hosts some of my projects that I either completed or was made to hone my skills (can be both) which include websites, aniamtions/art, and writings. It is my experience with these projects that have helped mold my skills for coding and other fields the experience from all of them generally 
    makes me confident in my abilities. But web projects were also done under lots of stress due to the nature of having to complete these on a 
    deadline and also having to learn what you're doing first but you will always find your footing in the end if you keep on pushing on. If you want to try out or see my projects click links below that lead you to them.</p>
